# Borgbackup automation of LVM-based virtual-machines
#
# This script needs to be run by cron
# Connects to REMOTE_HOSTS via SSH pubkey authentication (root user), 
# checks for running VMs and backup those to the local REPO. Also checks for
# running VMs on LOCALHOST itself and backup those as well.
#
# *** ALL VMS NEED TO HAVE THEIR DISKS FROM LVM-BASED VOLUMES ***
#     eg. /dev/myvolumegroup/host_jimmy
#
# Each VM is snapshotted and the filesystem is freezed for a short moment (1-5s)
# Then the VM is backuped, while only the chunks/blocks which differ from the last
# backup are stored. The backups are stored as a complete VM disk file inside of
# a borg-based repository. Between different backups only the chunks/blocks which
# have changed are backuped, so that a complete backup of a 100G host-volume can
# lead to just few MegaBytes beeing backuped.
# 
# More details about borg on the borg website: http://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/
